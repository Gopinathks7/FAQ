con.close();
Please refer class notes for details.
21) differences between overloading and overriding, what is polymorphism, what is abstraction and write a program which shows me something which I understand about these concepts.
Ans- overloading – developing the same method with different arg type.
Overriding- developing the methods with same method signature but different method body. Inheritace must for overriding.
Polymorphism- an object showing different behaviour at different stages of development is known as Polymorphism.
Abstraction- its like hiding the implementations of the methods.
ex- class A{
void test1(){
System.out.println(“test1 of A”);
}
}
class B extends A{
void test1(){
System.out.println(“test1 of B”);
}
}
class C extends B{
void sample(A  a){
System.out.println(“sample method”);
a.test1();
}
}
class D{
public static void main(String[] args){
C c1 = new C();
c1.sample(new A());
c1.sample(new B());
c1.test1();
}
}
output of this program -
A
B
B
22) write a program to check if the given input is palindrome or not by taking input from user at runtime.
Ans- class Palindrome{
public static void main(String[] args){
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int n = in.nextInt();
int a = n;
int palindrome =0;
int r = 0;
while(n>0){
r = n%10;
n = n/10;
palindrome = palindrome*10 + r;
}
if(palindrome==a){
System.out.println(a+” number is palindrome.”);
}else{
System.out.println(a+” number is not palindrome.”);
}
}
}
23) what is advantages of using testng, why can't we run selenium code directly?
Ans- can have 3kinds of report, parallel execution, skip a particular tc, change the order of execution, lots of annotaions, can execute without main method etc..
It is not necessary to use testng.xml to run the selenium code. You can directly run your selenium code. In order to create a test suite and run seperate test cases, you need some framework which drive the automation. Here testng.xml can be called as "driver" which drives several test cases automated using selenium code.

24) have you worked on Jenkins? What is advantages of it? What if developer does not use Jenkins, but testing team has been asked to use it? Can you do so without developer creating the build in Jenkins, your automation code can start?
Ans- Jenkins is a continues integration  tool; we use it to start the framework execution automatically as soon as the build is received from dev team ; If Dev team is not using Jenkins still testing team can use it where we can schedule the framework execution time or we can write customized script which can trigger the Frame Work

25)disadvantages and advantages of selenium, where can all I not use selenium?
Ans-Disadvantages- can't automate windows based application, Cant Handle Tab Browseres ,Cant Handle Existing Browser; Cant Hanled Flex/Flash application etc.
Advantages- Free,Open Source, Platform independed;Supports All Browsers
26) given just 2days and you have like 100 testcases to manually execute and your colleague is on long leave, what will you do? U think this situation can occur real time? Can u execute all testcases alone within deadlines?
Ans- depends on the complexity of the application, if the each tc won't take much time then we can execute 100 tc. If it's taking much time in that case we will execute the test case's on the priority and severity basis. Like new test cases should be executed and if time remain then we will try to execute as many as we can from the existing tcs.
27) what is the code to find the active element in the web page?
Ans- List<WebElement> allElements = driver.findElements(By.xpath("//*"));
for(int i=0;i<allElements.size();i++)
{
WebElement e=allElements.get(i);

if(e.isEnabled())
{
System.out.println(e.getTagName());
}
}

28) write a selenium program to verify that the navigation of the web page is landing at the correct URL at the next page..
Ans- driver.fiindElement(By.xpath(“xpath of anylink which u wan to check”)).click();
String expURL = “give expected url”;
String act = driver.getCurrentUrl();
Assert.assertEquals(act,exp);

29) write a code to make use of assert if my username is incorrect.
Ans- try{
Assert.assertEquals(actUserName),expUserName)
}catch(Exception e){
Syste.out.println(“name is invalid”);
}
30) what is the skeleton of testng.xml? What all does/can it contain?
Ans-
suite
|- test
|-classes
|- class

refer http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#testng-xml
31) code for switching frames back and forth( getting into frames and out to main frame)
Ans-
driver.switchTo().frame(arg);
driver.switchTo().defaultContent();
32) write a program to extract information from xl sheet and print it to the reporting sheet(reporter.log) and console.
Ans- FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(“path of file”);
Workbook wb = WorkbookFactory.create(fis);
String info = wb.getSheet(“SheetName”).getRow(rownum).getCell(cellNum).getStringCellValue();
Reporter.log(info, true);
33) how confident are you in manual testing,selenium,java?
Ans- out of 10- manual – 7, selenium-9, and java – 9.
34) code to write the usage of actions class with an example, usage of select class
Ans- ex- Actions act = new Actions(driver);
act.moveToElement(webElement).perform();
Select sel = new Select(WebElement);
sel.selectByValue("v");
35) switching between the two browsers(parent and child), popup differences and identification.
Ans- Iterator<String> it = driver.getWindowHandles().iterator();
String parent = it.next();
String child = it.next();
driver.switchTo().window(child);
driver.switchTo().window(parent);

There are 6 Diff types of Popups-Alert;Hidden Div;Page on Load;File Upload;File Download;Window popup
(Refer class notes for details)

Ans- we can store it inside project i.e. open the java project and copy the .xls file there and use it.
3.Different way to find out the web elements?
Ans- xpath(), tagName(), className(), linkText(), partialLinkText(), cssSelector(), id(), name().
4.What is the command to open the Firefox Browser and URL?
Ans- WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
driver.get(“url”); or driver.navigate().to(“url”);
5.What is Hybrid Framework?
Ans- Its is the combinations of Datadriven, method driven, modular driven frameworks.
6.What is the difference between Hybrid Framework and Function driven Framework?
Ans- In Function driven fw,we use the same functions/methods again and again by calling them in different modules. Hybrid driven framework is the combinations of Datadriven, method driven, modular driven frameworks.
7.When we use CSS Selector?
And- it is used to find any web element in the web page. Some time it is better to use css selector in place of xpath because of performance point of view.

18. What is a constructor and when will you use this and super in a constructor?
Constructor is special kind of method and use to initialise the non statci members of the class 
The name of the constructor should be as same as the class name
There are two type of constructor zero argument and parametrised constructor
All java should have constructor
By default compiler writes default constructor at th time of complie  implictly
If user write the consrutctor expacilty then complier dont write default constructor

Super statment is used to invlke the super class constructor to sub class constructor
Super statment should be alwasy writtenin first line of the constructor
If use dont write super statment then compiler write super statment implictly
If construct have any paramanet then user has to write super statment by passing parameter
