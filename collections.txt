HashSet stores the elements by using a mechanism called hashing.
HashSet contains unique elements only.
HashSet allows null value.
HashSet class is non synchronized.
HashSet doesn't maintain the insertion order. Here, elements are inserted on the basis of their hashcode.
HashSet is the best approach for search operations.

 important points about Java LinkedHashSet class are:

Java LinkedHashSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Java LinkedHashSet class provides all optional set operation and permits null elements.
Java LinkedHashSet class is non synchronized.
Java LinkedHashSet class maintains insertion order

The important points about Java TreeSet class are:

Java TreeSet class contains unique elements only like HashSet.
Java TreeSet class access and retrieval times are quiet fast.
Java TreeSet class doesn't allow null element.
